/**
 * is used to generate a random BA. a random Buchi automaton is generated over
 * an alphabet made by two propositions a, b. For each proposition of the
 * alphabet a random directed graph with a single initial state and $k$
 * transition is generated. The ``hardness" of the problem is changed by
 * controlling the density of the transitions, i.e., the ratio between the
 * number of transitions per input letter and the number of the states
 * ($r=|\Delta|/|Q|$), and the density of \emph{accepting} states, i.e., the
 * ratio between the accepting states and the total number of the states
 * ($f=|F|/|Q|$). The transition density represents the expected number of
 * transition that exits a state. The generation procedure also imposes that the
 * initial state has an outgoing transition for each proposition of the
 * alphabet, which allows to not consider trivial cases. The number of accepting
 * states, which are selected randomly between the set of the states of the
 * BA/IBA, is a linear function of the number of the states of the system.
