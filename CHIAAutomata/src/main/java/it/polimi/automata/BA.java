/**
 * <p>
 * Represents a Buchi Automaton. The BA class contains the description of a
 * Buchi Automaton. The BA class is based on the DirectedPseudograph class of
 * the JGrapT library. The DirectedPseudograph allows to create a non-simple
 * directed graph in which both graph loops and multiple edges are permitted.
 * The BA class maintains the set of initial states, the set of accepting
 * states, and the alphabet of the Buchi Automaton. The constructor of the BA
 * requires to specify the transition factory to be used, depending on whether
 * the BA is used to represent the model or the claim to be checked. The BA
 * class provides methods to access the elements of the BA, such as the one that
 * allow to get the successors of a state (getSuccessors()) to obtain the
 * initial states (getInitialStates()). <br>
