<!-- 
 The traffic is controlled by a pair of simple portable traffic light units one
 unit at each end of the one-way section connect(ed) to a small computer
 that controls the sequence of lights.
 Each unit has a Stop light and a Go light.
 The computer controls the lights by emitting RPulses and GPulses, to which
 the units respond by turning the light on and off.
 The regime for the lights repeats a fixed cycle of four phases. First, for
 50 seconds, both units show Stop; then, for 120 seconds, one unit shows
 Stop and the other Go; then for 50 seconds both show Stop again; then for
 120 seconds the unit that previously showed Go shows Stop, and the other
 shows Go. Then the cycle is repeated.-->
